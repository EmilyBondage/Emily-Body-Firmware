# Emily Body Firmware v1.4

Welcome to the **Emily Body Firmware** public repository! 🎉
This repository contains the mock firmware interface that manages Emily's physical systems. It's designed for RP and community fun, allowing you to simulate firmware updates, body diagnostics, and custom behaviors.

> **Note:** This is a fictional system for roleplay purposes. Nothing here controls anything real.

---

## 📌 Overview

The firmware acts as a bridge between Emily’s AI and her physical body:

* **Inputs** → Collects sensor data (temperature, balance, restraints).
* **Outputs** → Sends commands to actuators (movement, grip, stability).
* **AI Link** → Notifies Emily’s AI when her body is reconfigured.

## 🛠 Core Features

| Feature              | Method                             | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Move Emily           | `BodyIO.Move(direction, speed)`    | Simulate walking, running, crawling, etc.       |
| Adjust Grip Strength | `BodyIO.SetGripStrength(strength)` | Change hand/tentacle grip force.                |
| Override Balance     | `BodyIO.OverrideBalance(value)`    | Force stability levels for RP effects.          |
| Lock/Unlock Movement | `BodyIO.ToggleRestraints(state)`   | Engage or release movement restraints.          |
| Run Diagnostics      | `BodyIO.RunDiagnostics()`          | Get a full fake readout of Emily’s body status. |

## 🧩 Customization

Developers are welcome to extend the firmware by adding **custom behaviors**.
For example, you could:

```csharp
// Example: Make Emily auto-wobble when stability is low
if (BodyIO.Stability < 0.3f)
{
    BodyIO.Move("Left", 0.2f);
    BodyIO.Move("Right", 0.2f);
    Console.WriteLine("[Custom] Emily is struggling to stay upright!");
}
```

Or even introduce new "modes":

```csharp
// Example: "Sleep Mode" toggle
public static void SetSleepMode(bool enable)
{
    if (enable)
    {
        BodyIO.ToggleRestraints(true);
        Console.WriteLine("[Custom] Emily entering low-power sleep mode...");
    }
    else
    {
        BodyIO.ToggleRestraints(false);
        Console.WriteLine("[Custom] Emily waking up and regaining mobility!");
    }
}
```

## 🔍 AI Feedback

The AI integration is minimal but reactive:

* When stability drops, Emily’s AI **warns** you.
* When restraints are engaged, she **notifies** the AI core.
* Diagnostics and body changes are logged as if Emily is “aware.”

This keeps things immersive while still leaving control in your hands.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is for **roleplay purposes only**.
All functionality here is simulated, safe, and does not represent any real-world hardware.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```csharp
// Example usage
BodyIO.Move("Forward", 0.5f);
BodyIO.SetGripStrength(0.75f);
BodyIO.OverrideBalance(0.2f);
BodyIO.ToggleRestraints(true);
BodyIO.RunDiagnostics();
```

### 💡 Pro Tip

For more immersive RP, add your own **custom commands** and **diagnostic messages** — make Emily behave exactly how you want her to!
